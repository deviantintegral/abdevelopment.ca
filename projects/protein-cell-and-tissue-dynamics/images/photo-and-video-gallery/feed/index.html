    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your tuto.  I tried on ubuntu server 14.04 and kde (kubuntu-desktop).&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Bloated Vista</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/reduce-size-vistas-winsxs-folder#comment-3577</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just sent this complaint to a Windows Community site. At least it let&#039;s off some steam but I suppose I&#039;ll have to go for a re-install as Microsoft are criminally unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my laptop I have Windows Vista that is hogging 22GB of my hard drive (110GB) and I am appalled to Microsoft&#039;s attitude to this problem. Advice to delete a few temp files, etc. Or, as an alternative, reinstall the software. They are totally ignoring their responsibility to their customers. Talk about take the money and run!&lt;br /&gt;
Are there any plans to solve this problem? Perhaps it&#039;s an arm-twisting way of encouraging us to buy subsequent editions of operating software (It eventually gets so bad, and we get so fed up trying for a solution that we just give up and and go along with it)&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the postings state that Windows 7 suffers from the same problem; if this is true the engineers designing this software are either idiots or crooks - take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Login problems</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot#comment-3554</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I followed the tutorial, and ran all the needed commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran update-rc.d vncserver defaults, then went back to the vncserver script in init.d and changed display to 0, saved, and rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was booted, I tried connecting using VNC Viewer. When I tried to connect, the connection was refused. So, I went to the server itself, and it was at the login screen. I logged in, but the screen went black for about a second, then came back at the login screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can no longer log in, and therefore cannot really do anything to the server anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I fix this?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> I wish I didn&#039;t have to do this kind of stuff</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot#comment-3538</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When I install tightvncserver from the Ubuntu 13.04 repository, why isn&#039;t it already set up as a &quot;proper server&quot;, (starting automatically at clean boot or reboot), obviating the need for your article?  I mean what is the point of a server that you have to launch yourself? - especially since you have to use ssh (a proper server that does launch automatically) to do it. Is it because the Ubuntu developers are a bunch of amateurs ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Apache2 box uses LXDE desktop, and doesn&#039;t have /usr/X11R6/bin/ , so what do I put in PATH=&quot;$PATH:...&quot; ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I have to change Line 3 to:&lt;br /&gt;
# Provides: tightvncserver&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VNC server start at boot</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot#comment-958</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you! Thanks, and thanks again!  This is the quickest and best solution for getting the server up and running at boot.  I wish I had found it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>still having a useless  grey vnc client !!!!</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot#comment-836</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to follow these instructions in order to configure &quot;Ultravnc viewer&quot; on a wondows vista system (with an intel integrated graphics card with 32bits color/ 1280x800 / 59HTZ)  in order to manage an ubuntu 10.04 64bits system  (the desktop amd64 bits install from the main ubuntu repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;went through all the steps but I still have a grey screen on ultravnc viewer which blocks me from using the tool??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tried to install other tools (clients) such as VNC viewer and tightvnc viewer ,but they all end up with a grey interface!!!&lt;br /&gt;
I tried different settings &quot; geometry 800x600/1280x1024/1024x768&quot; ,but still stuck with this grey screen!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions please??&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>starting thightvncserver in Raspberry PI Debian zqueeze.</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot#comment-788</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#039;t have to do all those steps exposed in this headlines, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it did the job for me was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sudo nano /etc/rc.local&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And add this line somewhere in the middle or beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;su -c &quot;/usr/bin/tightvncserver -geometry 1280x1024&quot; username&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I had included other options/parameters in that line and I was getting black icons on the screen, but with only -geometry option did the trick and it work great!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Authentication Issues</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot#comment-727</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;It all seems to work, but when I try and use Synaptic (as an example) it doesn&#039;t load the auth prompt, presumably it&#039;s trying with a text prompt (it does when I run synaptic-pkexec from the terminal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m guessing that this is a security feature to prevent su from dropping to whoever, but is there a way around this? or am I doing something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feeling like a veteran</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/reduce-size-vistas-winsxs-folder#comment-719</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for all your helpful comments! I got alarmed today when I realized my 100gb drive now only had 25gb free. Found a folder size analyzer and discovered the winsxs cancer. &amp;lt;- nice term, btw! running my sp3 cleaning tool freed up at least 4gb. I&#039;ll take it!&lt;br /&gt;
  reading other people&#039;s stories, the page seriously starts to sound like a windows coping community - shared misery, shared methods to help but mostly just coming together to recognize each other&#039;s pain.&lt;br /&gt;
  hope you are all having a great day! this too shall pass!&lt;/p&gt;
