    <title>To clarify the slides</title>
    <link>http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/waterloo-region-december-meeting-drupal-hosting#comment-2</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Sounds good, thanks for the link. I&#039;ll be sure to include them next time a client asks me to do a hosting evaluation for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably clarify since the slides only contain company names, but none of my experiences with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far I&#039;ve had very good experiences with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.korax.net/&quot;&gt;Korax&lt;/a&gt; both in terms of support and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the one site I had with &lt;a href=&quot;http://baremetal.ca/&quot;&gt;BareMetal&lt;/a&gt;, support was excellent but performance looked to be an issue with shared hosting. It was a small site so we never bothered to look into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teksavvy.com/&quot;&gt;TekSavvy&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;strong&gt;horrific&lt;/strong&gt; on all accounts. While they have a great reputation for DSL service, I&#039;d never ever do hosting with them. I&#039;ve never seen a server so poorly managed and a complete disregard for their clients needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ssl.sentex.ca/&quot;&gt;Sentex&lt;/a&gt; is great for those who like physical contact as they actually have an office in Cambridge, ON. I&#039;ve used them with local clients who are skittish about dealing with a company purely over the &#039;net. Howevery, they are rather expensive. They&#039;re great for those who want to colo a box without having to go to Toronto for repairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow Ontarians :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://blamcast.net/an-hosting-review&quot;&gt;AN Hosting&lt;/a&gt;, they meet your requirements list, and I&#039;ve had good experiences with them.&lt;/p&gt;
